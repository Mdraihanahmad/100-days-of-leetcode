💡 Approach: Expand Around Center
A palindrome mirrors around its center.

We try to expand around every possible center (both odd and even length).

Track the maximum length and update the start/end pointers accordingly.

🧠 What You Learn:
Efficient string traversal without extra space.

Mastering palindromic expansion logic.

Handling both even and odd length palindromes.

⏱ Time & Space Complexity:
Time: O(n²) — Two nested loops (for center expansion).

Space: O(1) — No extra space used.
