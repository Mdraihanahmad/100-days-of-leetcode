👨‍💻 Language: C++

💡 Approach: Binary Search on the Smaller Array (O(log(min(m, n))))

🔸 Ensured the binary search is performed on the smaller array for efficiency.
🔸 Partitioned both arrays to balance the left and right halves.
🔸 Compared the edge values of the partitions to determine the correct median.
🔸 Carefully handled even and odd total lengths for correct median calculation.

🧠 What I Learned:
✅ Mastered the concept of binary search in complex problems.
✅ Learned how to balance two partitions across two arrays.
✅ Understood the power of optimizing search space using constraints.
✅ Got comfortable with INT_MIN and INT_MAX edge case handling in C++.
