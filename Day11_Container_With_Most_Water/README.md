**Link:** [LeetCode - Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### ðŸš€ Problem Statement:
Given `n` vertical lines, find two lines that form a container such that the container contains the **most water**.

### ðŸ’¡ Approach: Two Pointer Technique (O(n))
- Start with two pointers at the left and right ends.
- Calculate the area and move the pointer with the shorter height.
- Track the maximum area throughout.

ðŸ§  What I Learned:
âœ… How to use two pointers for optimal solution  
âœ… Intuition behind moving the shorter line  
âœ… Efficient area calculation logic using min and width  
âœ… Practiced edge-case handling when heights vary
